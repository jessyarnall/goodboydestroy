I've always considered myself a "sci-fi" fan. These were the books I loved reading, the best genre! A few years ago I hit a wall, though (okay, maybe more than a few years ago). I would get science fiction books and try to read them, get bored, or distracted, or busy, and never touch them again. I was beginning to think I just didn't enjoy reading anymore. 

I made a 2023 goal that I would "read more." My goal was 12 books in 2023 - a book a month should be enough of a challenge while not insurmountable, right? 

I started borrowing books from the local library. I looked up top science fiction novels and put in my borrow requests. I would get a book, try reading a few chapters, get bored, and run out of time. Off to the library I went to return my book and pick up a new one. 

One book a month was starting to seem insurmountable. 

I started reading some non-fiction; topics I knew about and had an interest in, such as statistics and artificial intelligence. I was able to get through these books, why? 

Then I picked up Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir, read a few pages, read a few more, was halfway done in a day. Wait a minute, what was going on, did I like sci-fi again? What was different? 

I looked a bit deeper into the book, noticed some places labelled it as "hard science fiction." What? the book wasn't "hard." I was just reading about statistics and artificial intelligence last month, I'd hardly consider Project Hail Mary difficult. 

More investigating and I had quite the facepalm moment. Hard science fiction is a subgenre. But this was great news! Apparently I liked hard science fiction! 

I started searching for other hard sci-fi novels and really hit my stride. I found these books interesting, engaging, and "hard" to put down. I was going to hit my 12 books in 2023 goal!

It turns out I do like reading, I do like sci-fi, I was just reading the wrong subgenres. 

In the coming weeks, I will be diving deeper into the different subgenres of science fiction. This will serve as a learning experience for me and hopefully for you too! I'll also include some of the top books in each subgenre, with the goal of reading each. Maybe I like more than just hard science fiction.
